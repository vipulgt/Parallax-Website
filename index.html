      <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time!</h2>
      <p class="text">
        There is a very famous quote by Hellen Keller, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” An adventure is something challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and forces us to try new things.<br><br> The definition of adventure varies from person to person. It can best be described as, “The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which may also be dangerous or in favour.”

        <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="text">
        Biking is a healthy, low-impact exercise that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, from young children to older adults. It is also fun, cheap and good for the environment.
        <br><br>
        Riding to work or the shops is one of the most time-efficient ways to combine regular exercise with your everyday routine. An estimated one billion people ride bicycles every day – for transport, recreation and sport.

        <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="text">
        Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paraglide: lightweight, freeflying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness
        suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air
        entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the
        outside. <br><br>
        Despite not using an engine, paraglide flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of
        kilometers, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometers are more the
        norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes
        of a few thousand meters

        <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="text">
        Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
        <br><br>
        The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards.
